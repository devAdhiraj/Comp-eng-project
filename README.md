# Grade 12 - Computer Engineering Project
This is the source code for my grade 12 Computer Engineering Project. 
The device's purpose is to count and track the number of people in an area and upload that information to a website.
This device can be placed at a store for instance, and it can help track how many people are in the store. This information can be useful during the pandemic to follow social distancing laws. To learn more about this project visit [the project website](https://devadhiraj.github.io/compengproject/).

* [about.html](about.html)
* [script.js](script.js)
* [main.css](assets/css/main.css)
* [Arduino Code](https://github.com/devAdhiraj/compengproject/blob/gh-pages/Arduino%20Code/Product_Code/Product_Code.ino)

## Arduino Code ##
The code for arduino is in the Arduino Code/Product Code Folder, it contains comments explaining what each part of the code does.

## Website Code ##
An [HTML5 UP Template](https://html5up.net/massively) was used for the basic design of the website, please see [README.txt](README.txt) to learn more about the template. However, the design and style of the website was modified. The specific modifications are discussed in each file.

### HTML Files ###
The index.html and about.html files contain the code which creates the basic structure of the website and provides content that is going to be displayed on the website.

### Back-end ###
The script.js is a Java Script file. This file contains code which is responsible for creating a GET API request for the piechart. Then, it stores the data into variables and uses the values in those variables to create the piechart. It also contains logic to handle situations when there is no data available.

### images folder ###
The images folder contains all the images that were used in the website.

### Assets Folder ###
The assets folder contains 4 more folders - 
* css

The CSS folder contains 3 files in it. Please ignore the fontawesome-all.min and noscript file.
Main.css is the file that is responsible for most of the styling of the website.

### js folder ###
Please ignore this folder as it just contains code to make the website responsive and compatible with multiple browsers.

### sass folder###
