# Grade 12 - Computer Engineering Project
This is the source code for my grade 12 Computer Engineering Project. 
The device's purpose is to count and track the number of people in a room and publish that information to a website.

# Viewing the Code

## Arduino Code ##
The code for arduino is in the Arduino Code/Product Code Folder, it contains comments explaining what each part of the code does.

## Website Code ##

### HTML Files ###
The index.html and about.html files contains the code which creates the basic structure of the website and provides content that is going to be displayed on the website.

### Back-end ###
The script.js is a Java Script file. This file contains code which is responsible for creating a GET API request for the piechart. Then, it stores the data into variables and uses the values in those variables to create the piechart. It also contains logic to handle situations when there is no data available.


Please ignore the README.txt file.

The images folder contains all the images that were used in the website.

The assets folder contains 4 more folders -
